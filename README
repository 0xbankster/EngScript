# EngScript

EngScript is a programming language designed for seamless collaboration between humans and large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. It combines the simplicity of Python, the performance of Rust, and the concurrency model of Go with an English-like syntax that aims to maximize human readability.

## Features

- English-like syntax for enhanced readability
- Hybrid interpreter with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for quick prototyping and improved performance
- Support for multiple platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly
- Implemented in Rust for safety guarantees and performance
- Designed to facilitate collaboration between humans and LLMs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust compiler and Cargo (for building EngScript)
- Platform-specific dependencies (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux)
